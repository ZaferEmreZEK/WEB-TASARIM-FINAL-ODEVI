    <h1>'Pes' dedirtti! Kendi şartlarını sıralıyorlar<br>"En fazla 500 bin kredi"</h1>

    <p>    Middle-income individuals who will buy a house are researching the new housing campaign. Those who want to take advantage of the low housing loan interest rate of 0.69 and a 15-year term face a situation that seems like an obstacle in front of the campaign. This obstacle is the developers who show the sales price much lower than its actual value to evade taxes. Those looking for a new house are told that the sale cannot be made if they report the actual sales price to the bank. Some receive the answer "maximum 500 thousand loan" while others are asked for cash up to 80% of the sales price.</p>
    <p>    In order to revive the housing market, both banks and the government have announced the "My First Home" financing model for middle-income citizens. Those who want to use the loans starting from a 0.69 interest rate have entered the search for new zero houses within the scope of the new housing project. However, individuals interested in zero houses built by non-corporate and mostly referred to as neighborhood contractors faced an unexpected situation. For example, when they talked to the intermediary real estate agents and contractors about a zero house with a sales value of 2 million, they received the response, "You can only go to the bank for a maximum of 500 thousand loans. Because we have shown a lower price for the house due to taxes. We have to take the rest in cash and you cannot submit the house for bank evaluation. Otherwise, we cannot make the sale." This led to the question, "Then how are we going to buy a house?"</p>
